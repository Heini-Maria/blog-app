# Nerdy Facts  = Micro blogging platform

Personal full stack project to practise rest APIs and to understand the relationship between back- and front-end. 
The react application is created from scratch, using webpack.

Nerdy Facts is a microblogging platform that allows logged-in users to create new posts, and delete and edit them. 
Users can also like and comment on posts created by other users.

## Personal experience 

This was my first time building the server and database and taught me a lot. I countered multiple challenges especially while deploying the application,
but was delighted to notice how much quicker I've become at building the front end. 
I still have things that I wish to improve in the code and will certainly keep on updating the project as I learn more. 

Any feedback is highly appreciated.
