## Personal experience 

This was my first time building the server and database and taught me a lot. I countered multiple challenges especially while deploying the application,
but was delighted to notice how much quicker I've become at building the front end. 
I still have things that I wish to improve in the code and will certainly keep on updating the project as I learn more. 

Any feedback is highly appreciated.
